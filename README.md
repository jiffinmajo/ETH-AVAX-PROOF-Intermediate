# ETH-AVAX-PROOF-Intermediate
Metacrafters Assignment
ETH + AVAX PROOF: Intermediate EVM Course
Projects that Metacrafters have assigned in the Blockchain course.

# Description
This repository contains the assignments
All the projects of this repository are related to the Blockchain written in Solidity and JavaScript (languages).

# Functions and Errors
In this Project i have to write a contract which has the use of revert(),require() and assert() statement. So i have created a contract name FunctionAndError and inside this i have created a function which takes the input from the user like address and amount and then check for the ownership using require() statement an then check for the available balance is greater then the inputed amount using revert() statement and if true then complete the transection.

At the end i have created a checkAssert function which has one assert() statement to check for the internal errors.

# Smart Contract Management 
For this project i have to create a contract which has some basic functions, So i have created a contract called MyBank and inside this i have created three functions one to check the balance and one to deposite and one for withdraw. i have added the modifier to withdraw so that only the owner can withdraw. And at the end i have connect it to frontend and interact from frontend.

# Types of Functions
In this Project i have to create our own token so i have created a contract which ask for Token name And symbol at the time of deployment. After the deployment i have perform some operation like mint,burn,transfer.

In mint function i have added a modifier so that only owner of that tocken can mint the token

# Building on Avalanche
This is the final assignment of the course, i am showing my contract making DEGEN token on the Avalanche fuji testnet.
Executing the required and taught functions, and the user can mint, burn and transfer the token.
I am also able to show the verified transactions on the snowtrace explorer of Avalanche
